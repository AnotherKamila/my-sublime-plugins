Kamila's Sublime Text 2 Plugins
===============================

Yes, it's true. After all those SLOC, I have decided to try [a different editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/2). Here come some plugins to help me overcome this challenge.

eopen -- `:e`-like file open
----------------------------

I can't stand those evil, slow and ugly Gtk2 file open/save dialogs. Therefore I have decided to make a terribly simple vim-like :e prompt that opens a file (the path can be absolute or relative to the currently opened file's directory). There is no tab-completion or anything fancy (yet?), but unlike Gtk, it is fast (and since you provide the filename at the beginning, there is no need to use the save dialog either).

Theme - Solarized
-----------------

This is a quick & dirty imagemagick-recolored version of the default theme -- the statusbar and scrollbars were changed to match the great Solarized colorscheme.

Installation
============

with Package Control
--------------------

TODO

manually
--------

Head over to [the Downloads section](https://github.com/AnotherKamila/my-sublime-plugins/downloads), and place the plugin of your choice into the Installed Packages directory. Then restart Sublime Text.
